# Lazy Tab Reader

Too lazy to transcribe, but not too lazy to write an app to read other people's amazing tabs; one frame at a time...

MASSIVE SHOUT OUT TO https://www.youtube.com/c/CoverSolutions!

Thank you for all the consistent content, accurate tabs. A bass practice wouldn't be complete without at least 3-4 hours of play alongs. ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸŽ¸ ðŸŽ¸ ðŸŽ¸

## Introduction

Cheap and easy way to transcribe without whipping out MuseScore or any other muscial notation software. Simply screenshot
a bunch of frames once, add a little helping config, and you're ready to JAM!

## Getting Started

Static webpage! That's right, no fancy front-end development framework, also too lazy to make a GitHub Page.

Simply, follow these no-nonsense steps:

1. Download the project as a ZIP
2. Decompress the downloaded file
3. Open `LazyTabReader.html`
4. New tab will open in browser with songs that have been captured to-date. You're welcome ðŸ˜‰

## How to add new song

To add a new song to be supported by the LazyTabReader, do the following:

1. Create new folder with the pattern: `${Artist} - ${Song name} (${Year})` (this needs to match your song ID exactly)
2. Create subfolder `frames`
    1. Take screenshots and save to `frames`
    2. Once all frames are created, rename accordingly, in order (1-indexed, with zero prefix buffer)
4. Add new song to song bank
    1. Open `SongBank.js` and add new entry using the provided template as a starting point
    2. Make appropriate song data adjustments
5. Open `index.html`
    1. From UI, click the song that you wish to play
6. Ready to JAM

### Here's what a template config looks like

```javascript
{
               id : "{ARTIST} - {SONG_TITLE} ({RELEASE_YEAR})",
            title : 'SONG_TITLE',
         subtitle : 'ALBUM_NAME (RELEASE_YEAR)',
           artist : 'ARTIST_NAME',
  instrumentalist : 'INSTRUMENTALIST_NAME',
           source : 'LINK_TO_SOURCE',
     backingTrack : 'LINK_TO_BACKING_TRACK',
            style : 'STYLE',
           tuning : 'Standard Tuning',
            tempo : '100 BPM',
      totalFrames : 100,
       frameWidth : 1000,
      frameHeight : 200
}
```

## Trick for easier screenshotting sessions

1. Use `Cmd + Shift + 5`
2. Drag captured selection to appropriate area
3. Start playing your YouTube video that has tabs included
4. Click `Capture` when ready!
5. Repeat until song is done and all frames are captured!
6. Once all frames are screenshotted, all frames need to be indexed accordingly, can consider using the `__dev__/node_scripts/assignFrameIndex.js`, but that is definitely WIP

**NOTE:** final file names should have these characteristics:
- 1-indexed
- No gaps in file name sequencing (ie. 1,2,3,4,5 not 1,3,4,5)
- prefix with zero buffers to match maximium number of digits (e.g. 81 frames = 2 digits, so 1.png should be 01.png, 230 frames = 3 digits, so 1.png should be 001.png etc)

## Code Overview

- all main code driving this "app" is located under `__dev__`
- for a good investigation starting point, start with `LazyTabReader.html` and follow the code paths accordingly
- helper scripts are located under `__dev__/scripts`
